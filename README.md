# WikiKid

**WikiKid** is a web application that simplifies Wikipedia articles to a 4th-grade comprehension level. It leverages the power of Wikipedia - a python library, the GPT-4 API, and a Flask-based backend, with HTML and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Demo

Unfortunately, I do not currently have a public demo available for WikiKid due to the cost associated with using the GPT4 API. Running a public demo would require substantial ongoing expenses. You could connect your own API credentials to power your version of this project.


## Features

- **Simplified Wikipedia**: Input just a Wikipedia article name, and WikiKid will fetch and simplify the content to a 4th-grade comprehension level.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user-friendly web interface makes it easy for anyone to access simplified Wikipedia articles.

- **Powered by GPT-4**: GPT-4 API to generates the simplified text, ensuring high-quality and readable content.
